#### BMI710 Project Overview

This repository hosts the materials for the BMI 710 Final Project, involving the detailed analysis of a single-cell dataset. The project encompasses data processing, quality control, and advanced analytical techniques as outlined in the course curriculum.

#### Dataset Description
- **Source**: Selected from nine curated datasets provided by the course director on O2 cluster portal by HMS.
- **Content**: Includes data on tissue source, dissociation procedures, and single-cell isolation methods.

#### Analysis Components
1. **Quality Control**
   - Identify and address potential dataset issues using QC and batch correction methods.
2. **Data Processing**
   - Perform normalization, feature selection, and scaling.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization**
   - Employ PCA and UMAP for data simplification and visualization, with an explanation for the number of principal components used.
4. **Clustering and Cell Type Annotation**
   - Execute data clustering, select appropriate resolution, identify gene markers, and annotate clusters using relevant cell type classification resources.
5. **Downstream Analysis**
   - Conduct two of the following analyses: differential expression, differential abundance, or trajectory analysis, each addressing specific biological questions.

#### Files Included
- **Summary Report**: Describes methods and results, including figures. 
- **R Markdown File**: Contains all code used in the analysis.
